to run the program simply double click the login.exe shortcut 
if that does not work open the "libs" folder and double click the "login.exe" 
file.

honestly i don't think that i need all those dlls but i just copied the entire
bin folder from msys2 on windows to the folder and now it runs on all computers
without installing anything

the login information for the database is as follows:

	username: "postgres"
	password: "Austin12!"
	database: "ayame"
	ip: "esports.austinsprojects.com"
	port: "5432"


thanks for reading my README !
